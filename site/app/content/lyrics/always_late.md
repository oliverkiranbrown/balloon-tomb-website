# Always Late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late


Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

Where is my mate

He’s always fucking late

I’m waiting for a train

And it never fucking came

Cause of the delay

Every fucking day

I’m stood here in the rain

Why do I still pay


I’m looking like a twat for

Standing on the platform

Questions are always the same

Where the fuck is my train

It never fucking came


Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time


Fuck Thomas and Toby

That fat prick can blow me

Grow the fuck up

Get a grip

Small people on a power trip

Dishing out fines

But can’t afford to be on time

And you say the fault is mine

Leave me the fuck alone

My ticket is on my phone

Fuck southern rail

Fuck great western

fuck the rest of them


Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

(Train hate for bridge)

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

Always fuckin late

The trains are never on time

See it, Say it, sorted
