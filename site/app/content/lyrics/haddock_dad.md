I’m bad 
So bad 
So very very bad 
(Repeated) 

Plenty more fish in the sea 
couldn’t take them with me 
Left my tank behind 
Glad my parents didn’t mind 

125 litre  
Nearly 2 meter 
Platties and guppy 
Left them like nothing 

I’m bad 
So bad 
So very very bad

I Am 
A Bad

Abandoned my kids
Just cause they’re fish 
Even the shrimp 
Now that I think

125 litre  
Nearly 2 meter 
Platties and guppy 
Left them like nothing
