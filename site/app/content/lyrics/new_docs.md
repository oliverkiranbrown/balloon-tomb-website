# New Docs


I wish my friends thought I was tenta-cool

I'm feeling Misdreavus might scale a wall

I see a hot girl beg your pardon

Metapod encountered in the garden

Playing pokémon in the park

But I'm left without my crew

As useful as Magikarp

And I cry like pikachu

Finding love is FAR-fetched

My only bird is ZU-bat

Was tryna catch Charizard

When I heard you


bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs

bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs


Stuck on my back like a blastoise

Mumbling my words got small voice

You just look super chill

Got me buzzing like a beedrill



Playing pokémon in the park

But I'm left without my crew

The sky's full of STARmie

I lay low like sandshrew

Finding love is FAR-fetched

My only bird is ZU-bat

Was tryna catch Charizars

When I heard you

bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs

bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs



bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs

bumping loud tunes from your boom box

Strutting round town in ya new docs

In all black other than bright socks

But I'm stood here in my green crocs
